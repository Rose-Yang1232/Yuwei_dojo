# IMPORTANT! You must use the GUI Desktop Workspace for this Challenge!

# Challenge Instructions

This is an practice challenge for demonstrating how the eye tracking challenges work in this dojo.
The goal is to successfully curl to the server running in the background.

The webserver program is `/challenge/server`.
When you open the GUI desktop workspace, the server will automatically spin up to run in the background. You can talk to it over HTTP using the right terminal. The server's code is displayed in the left terminal.

You can communicate with the server using `curl http://challenge.localhost:80/` in the right terminal.

# Eye-Tracking Instructions

**This challenge uses your webcam to track eye movements.**  
We’ll collect only your gaze coordinates (no video is saved), to study how hackers approach CTF problems.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Webcam**: You must have a working webcam.  
- **Lighting**: A well-lit room helps improve accuracy.  
- **Browser Permissions**: When prompted, **allow** camera access.  

---

## 2. Calibration (~30 seconds)

1. When the GUI workspace opens, you’ll see a **white screen** with **9 red dots**.  
2. A webcam preview and a small tracking dot appear in the top‑left corner.  
3. **Click each red dot 5 times**, while looking directly at it.  
4. Dots will turn **yellow** when fully clicked.  
5. Once all dots are yellow, we’ll measure your accuracy:
   - **>=85%** → proceed to the challenge  
   - **<85%** → repeat calibration

## 3. During the Challenge

- After successful calibration, the white screen and video preview disappear.  
- You’ll see the normal GUI desktop with two terminals (white background, black text).  
- **Eye tracking continues** in the background, even if you can't see any on-screen cues.  
- **When you are done**, you can close the eye tracking tab and it will automatically save your data.

---

## 4. Tips for Best Accuracy

- Keep your monitor **at eye level** and your webcam **above the screen**.  
- Sit in a **well-lit** area.  
- Try to keep your **head still**. Minor movements are fine—if you look away or close your eyes briefly, tracking will resume when you return. 
- If you reload the page, you will have to recalibrate. 
- **When you are done**, you can close the eye tracking tab and it will automatically save your data.
